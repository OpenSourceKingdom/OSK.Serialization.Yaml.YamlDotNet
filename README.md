# OSK.Serialization.Yaml.YamlDotNet
This library provides an implementation for an `IYamlSerializer` using YamlDotNet as the backing mechanism. This serializer can be accessed via dependency injection or by creating a new `YamlDotNetSerializer`. Dependency injection can be added using the `AddYamlDotNetSerialization` service collection extension.

Please see the YamlDotNet project for more information on that package https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet.
